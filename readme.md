    function analyzeWithPrivacy(
        bytes32 reportHash,
        bytes calldata zkProof
    ) external returns (uint8 severityScore, bool isAuthentic) {
        // Analyze report without revealing content
        require(zkProof.verifyMLComputation(reportHash), "Invalid ZK proof");
        return processAnalysis(reportHash);
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
