Listen carefully, I want to make the report submission directly to metamask to upload the repot. 
in the frontend submit report, I do not want to submit the report through the admin itself. I want to submit through the wallet user.
Then in the report list, show only the wallet user reported list (can do frontend filter better). (getReportInfo in the contract)
when a certain report is clicked (report is gathered from the blockchain), user can decrypt with metamask.
the admin can see reporter report as well and can perform reward status and close the report. Please refer to the UserVerification.sol
I want the reports list shows the findings from the blockchain. not preset from the API, 
you can work on the API to pull the request or send the request.
or
do it directly with the metamask and frontend.

Please hide all the private key in the project in .env file. do not expose all the private key.
make sure this system follows the web3 goals.
