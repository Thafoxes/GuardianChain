when I am an admin I want to grade the submittede report to completed or cancel based on the report contract.sol then I want to reward the user for helping sending the report.

for the admin page, this is missing the component to grade the report.
Can you add it in? I want to add it after the reward status 
show a feedback after the submission is sent with like reporter is awarded with tokens,
if is declined reply with report is rejected and no reward is send to the reporter. 
Those report that are submitted will not be update again.
